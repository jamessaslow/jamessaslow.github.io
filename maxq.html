<h1>Mechanics of a Rocket With Exponentially Decreasing Mass Flow</h1>


<h2>Required Skills for completing this project</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Modeling stresses subject to a rocket during takeoff</li>
  <li>Constructing a model that simulates external forces at different times and altitudes</li>
  <li>Numerically Solving nonlinear differential Equations</li>
  <li>Mathematica Software & Wolfram programming </li>
</ul>  


<h2>Project Description and Background</h2>

<p> When I took classical mechanics in undergrad in 2019, I remember my professor talking about the most critical point during a rocket's takeoff: Max Q - The maximum dynamic pressure that a rocket has to withstand or else there will be devastating consequences. 2 years later, after I've sharpened my programming skills, I developed a Mathematica notebook that calculates Max Q given the specs of the Falcon 9 model. Later in my career, I took a Research and Professional writing for physics majors course at my university. For one of my semester projects, I created a poster of my independent research of rockets mechanics and presented it to my peers. I have my poster and Mathematica code posted below.</p>
