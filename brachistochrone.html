<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>This project finds the path of least time that a point mass can travel on between two points. The analytical solution to this problem is known as the Brachistochrone curve. This code approximates the Brachistochrone by optimizing a connection of inclined planes in series. The more inclined planes we add, the higher dimensionality the time function T takes on. In order to optimize T, we use a gradient descent algorithm to find the optimal positioning of our inclined planes in order to guarentee the fastest travel time. This project was originally my final project for my undergraduate Introductory Computational Physics class at San Jose State in 2019. However, during this time, I used a genetic algorithm approach to optimize T. The genetic algorithm approach, converges very slowly and isn't very useful for this type of problem where an expression for T is given. For this reason, I chose to revisit this project with a gradient descent approach, which turns out to be much more fast and reliable! </p>
