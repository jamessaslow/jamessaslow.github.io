	<h2>My Background</h2>
	<p> Hi! It's nice to meet you!
	<br>
	It seems you don't know much about me -- Let's change that!
	<br>
	I grew up in Southern California for all my life. I graduated from Moorpark High School in 2018. There, my love for physics blossomed as I never held myself back from any opportunity to advance my knowledge for the sciences. To tell you the truth, I was never such a big of math and science in my youth until I got to my junior year of high school when I took my first introductory physics course. I was so amazed that introductory physics could explain many phenonenon I have observed on a daily basis. My imagination persisted to dream up what other complicated and interesting systems I could model with physics. This high school class was the life experience that inspired me to become a computational physicist. Because I was inspired by a high school teacher of mine, I promise myself to one day become a professor so that way I can give back all the knowledge that was passed down to me. With my newfounded inspiration, I attended San Jose State University and I achieved my Bachelors of Science in Physics in December 2022 and graduated with Cumma Sum Laude. During my undergraduate career, I took every opportunity I could to learn about computational physics. I mastered several data science and machine learning methods that I can apply to physics problems.
