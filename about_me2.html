      <h3> print('My Skills') </h3>
      <h4> Throughout my undergraduate career, I've finely tuned my programming skills. I have experience in Python, C++, LaTeX, Wolfram Language, HTML, CSS, and more. In addition to Python, I'm well versed with numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and scipy modules.</h4>
      <h4> My Physics degree is a problem solving degree that grants me the superb intuition needed to tackle a multitude of problems from a variety of academic disciplines such as engineering, mathematics, and finance.</h4>

      <h4>I've used my programming skills to numerically solve partial differential equations, simulate quantum behavior of lattices via the Hubbard Model, and I have applied time series forecasting methods such as ARIMA models to forecast stock prices (and the list goes on).</h4>

      <h4>On the programming-specific side of things, I have experience in parallel programming, webscraping, data analysis, and data visualization. </h4>

      <h4>I consider myself a life long learner, thus my skillset is ever-evolving based on challenges that arise as well as personal research interests.</h4>
