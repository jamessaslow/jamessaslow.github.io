<h2>Project Description and Background</h2>

<p>I wrote this paper as a final project for my undergraduate modern physics class in 2020. I was very interested in what a quantum many body problem would look like and how, in addition, the Pauli Exclusion Principle and quantum entanglement play a role in the nature of Helium. I always thought how beautiful and intricate the wavefunction plots for Hydrogen were, and could only dream what such plots could look like for Helium. Despite all the nuiances that are caused by two electrons that are always entangled and repulsed by the electrostatic force, I wanted to paint the most accurate depiction of Helium as I possibly could. ALthough I couldn't actually generate any plots of a wavefunction for quantum Helium in this paper, this paper serves as an excellent primer for understanding the many challenges that come with quantum many body problems.</p>
