					<h3>
					Hello!
					<br> My name is James Saslow.

					</h3>

					<br>
					<h3> <i>I do physics on a computer </i></h3>

					<br> 
					<p>
					I am a skilled and versatile physicist with a passion for numerical simulations, equipped with a diverse set of programming, data science, and data analysis skills that can be applied to a range of innovative projects. My proficiency in Python, Mathematica, C++, machine learning, and numerical methods is just the start of what I can bring to the table.</p>

					<br>

					<p>In my previous role, I used my expertise in analyzing profits and costs of goods to help increase revenue by 10%. I conducted a thorough analysis of the company's financial data using data analysis and machine learning techniques, identified areas for improvement and provided strategic recommendations to management that delivered tangible results for the company. I am confident that I can bring this same level of expertise and dedication to your organization.</p>
					
					<br>

					<p>I also have experience conducting computational physics research and creating dynamic animations that bring complex scientific concepts to life. For example, I conducted a  research project where I developed simulations of membrane mechanics and created animations that accurately portrayed their dynamics. This project required creativity, technical expertise, and attention to detail, and I am proud of the results I achieved.</p>
					
					<br>
					<p>I also have scientific communication skills in being able to convey complex concepts in simplest terms possible. I have gained this skill as a result of my 5 years as an independent tutor and my experience as a grader at my university. These work experiences have taught me how important effective communication and mastery learning are in the realm of physics education. Furthermore, I have applied these skills to enhance teamwork and communication with others in collaborative work environments.
					</p>

					<br>
					<p>I thrive on finding new and better ways to solve problems, and I am excited to bring this energy and enthusiasm to your organization. Whether it's through developing innovative solutions to complex problems, creating dynamic visualizations that communicate complex concepts, or driving strategic initiatives that deliver tangible results, I am confident that I can make a valuable contribution to your organization.
					</p>
