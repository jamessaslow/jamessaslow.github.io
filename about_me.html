					Hello!
					<br> My name is James Saslow.
					<br>It's nice to meet you.
					<br> It seems that you don't know much about me.
					<br> Let's change that!
					</h3>
					<br> 
					<p>I'm a physicist with a passion for describing the world around me with numerical simulations. This passion of mine has lead me to gain an extensive skill set in programming, data science, and data analysis. Whether it concerns analyzing profits & costs of goods to make executive business descisions, engineering components in CAD, or numerically solving intensely chaotic partial differential equations, my versatile skill set will always allow for innovation to flourish in any environment.</p>
