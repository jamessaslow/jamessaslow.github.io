      <h3> \section{Work Experience} </h3>
      <h4> In the summer of 2020, I was an intern for the Leadership Alliance SR-EIP program as a computational biologist and soft matter researcher. I tasked with solving differential equations that describe the structure of a spherical colloidal membrane virus. Since structure determines function, calculating the structure of this virus tells us how the virus behaves. Especially during the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak, this was an extremely important facit of research. I presented my research at the Virtual Leadership Alliance National Symposium and was awarded a Professional Development Badge in recognition for my research. </h4>
