<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This project performs Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithms on test data generated from arbitrary multivariate gaussians. The script detects the clusters and identifies their mean, covaraince matrix, and probability of assignment. Although scikitlearn already posesses a "GaussianMixture" function that carries out this process automatically, I wanted to engineer this process for myself to understand the inner workings of the GMM. I also modified the GMM process by implementing K-means at the beginning to speed up the learning faster and have all parameters converge faster. All in all, this project has sharpened my understanding of machine learning and algorithm development.</p>
