      <h3> < h1 > Other Interests  < /h1 >  </h3>
      <h4> I grew up in Southern California and graduated from Moorpark High School before moving to San Jose to complete my bachelors. </h4>
      <h4>Outside of my academics, I really enjoy traveling! So far, I've been to 4 different countries: Panama, Colombia, Chile, and Mexico. It turns out I also have a passion for learning languages (along with new programming languages too!). I've been studying Spanish for about 2 years now and I am able to read, write, and speak it at an intermediate level! After I master Spanish, I'd like to learn a third language as well.</h4>

      <h4>I also enjoy staying active by weightlifting and occasionally running.</h4>

      <h4>I'm also actively involved in the restaurant business by helping out at my family owned cafe. I'm always an eager learner, and the restaurant business is no exception. I've learned how to perform every position as well as managerial responsibilities. Furthermore, I've also found myself playing "physicist" by forecasting customer traffic, managing large datasets of the prices of volatile ingredients, and by implimenting other profit optimization schemes.</h4>
